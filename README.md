A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language.
Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs. 
This makes RNNs well-suited for tasks where context and order are important, such as language modeling or speech recognition.

To predict the next word in a sequence with an RNN, the model processes each word in the input sequence one at a time.
At each step, the RNN updates its internal state (or hidden state) based on the current word and the previous state. 
Once the entire sequence is processed, the RNN uses its final hidden state to predict the next word by outputting a probability distribution over the vocabulary.
The word with the highest probability is typically chosen as the predicted next word. This process can be repeated to generate longer sequences of text.
